# Introduction

More than a 1000 words, a life example can show how things are done the right
away. This [Pankyll] theme rankle example is a pre-configured [Pankyll] theme
with a little bit of content to see how easy it is to set up a [Pankyll] site
with a rankle theme.

# Prerequisites

**TLTR:**

Requires [Pankyll](https://github.com/ckuelker/pankyll/) and for [Debian]
install the following:

As root

```shell
# aptitude install pandoc fonts-noto-cjk fonts-wqy-microhei make
```

As user

```shell
$ export URL=https://github.com/ckuelker/pankyll-theme-rankle-example.git
$ git clone --recursive $URL
```

## Pankyll

We assume that [Pankyll] is installed and that the script `pankyll` is in your
`PATH`. Read the [Pankyll] [README.md](https://github.com/ckuelker/pankyll/)
for more information.

## Pandoc

[Pandoc] is expected to be installed. While it is possible to run `pankyll`
with `pandoc` 1.x.x it will not produce good results. [Pankyll] was tested
with version 2.2.1 and should give good results.

**Installation for Debian:**

```shell
# aptitude install pandoc
```

## Fonts

To create PDF files from Markdown, the following fonts seem to produce the best
results. For [Pankyll] 0.1.0 the names are hard coded, that might change in
future releases.

* Noto Sans CJK JP
* Noto Sans Mono CJK JP Bold
* WenQuanYi Micro Hei Mono

**Installation for Debian:**

```shell
# aptitude install fonts-noto-cjk fonts-wqy-microhei
```

## Make

An optional control file (Makefile) is used to control easy build. If you do
not want to use it just run the `pankyll` command inside your project
directory. If you want to use it see the usage section.

**Installation for Debian:**

```shell
# aptitude install make
```

# Installation

Clone the example repository and its sub-modules

```shell
$ export URL=https://github.com/ckuelker/pankyll-theme-rankle-example.git
$ git clone --recursive $URL
```

# Usage

Update, build and see the site:

```shell
$ cd pankyll-theme-rankle-example
$ make submodule-update
$ make submoduleclean
$ make submodule-pull
$ make realclean
$ make build
$ make server
```
Or all at once:

```
$ make all
```
